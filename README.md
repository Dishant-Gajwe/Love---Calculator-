## **_How it Works_**

##### The code operates by employing a straightforward algorithm to gauge the love compatibility between two individuals, relying on their respective names. The algorithm unfolds in a series of steps:

##### 1. Convert each name to lowercase.
##### 2. Eliminate all spaces from each name.
##### 3. Tally the frequency of each letter in both names.
##### 4. Compute the sum of the products of these letter counts.
##### 5. Multiply the resultant sum by 100 to yield the love score.

#####  The calculated love score is subsequently showcased on the screen, providing users with an indication of their compatibility based on the entered names.
