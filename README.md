## **_How it Works_**

#### The code works by using a simple algorithm to calculate the love compatibility between two people based on their names. The algorithm works as follows:

#### 1. Convert each name to lowercase.
#### 2. Remove all spaces from each name.
#### 3. Count the number of times each letter appears in both names.
#### 4. Calculate the sum of the products of the letter counts.
#### 5. Multiply the sum by 100 to get the love score.

#### The love score is then displayed on the screen.
